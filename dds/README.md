# AAICO Coding Round - Suhail Ahmed

## Getting Started

Running this project will require an active internet connection. There is also a report titled "Assignment Report" attached detailing the project, its architecture and features supporting visualization. I would strongly recommend reading the report for a hollistc insight into the application.

### Prerequisites

Please install poppler-utils from the terminal.

#### Linux

```bash
apt-get install poppler-utils
```

If the above causes an error, please run it using sudo.

```bash
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

#### Mac

```bash
brew install poppler-utils
```

After installation of poppler-utils, please install the rest of the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Project

Please ensure that you are in the root directory: suhail-aaico. Upon doing so, please run the following command in the terminal. This will open the web application locally.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
